### Welcome, derfarctor here!

I am interested in blockchain, programming and cryptography. My current projects relate to nano and banano cryptocurrencies, and are as follows:
1. **dagchat** - a nano and banano wallet which can also send end to end encrypted messages using the in-house dagchat protocol
2. **brute** - a mnemonic brute forcing tool that can be used to recover wallets from mnemonic phrases with up to 5 missing words
